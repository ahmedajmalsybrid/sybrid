# Pentest Methodology
Short checklists to keep your pentests on track.

They are:
- Not exhaustive
- Not overly descriptive
- Not a replacement for PTES or OWASP


# Thanks
All of these items are things I picked up here and there, and it would be tough to credit every item. Here are some people/sources I definitely owe thanks to:

- All of the authors of the listed tools.
- [3xocyte](https://github.com/3xocyte) for his wealth of knowledge in destroying AD environments.
