# Introduction
Even though, a penetration test is a creative process most people maintain private checklists to ensure that they will not forget to test networks, systems and applications against various scenarios and maintain the overall quality of the assessment.

# Purpose
The aim of the project is to create detailed checklists that can be used by penetration testers and red teamers during their assessments. Every checklist will be linked with a detailed blog post on https://pentestlab.blog which will describe the technique and how to perform the required task. Information will also be included in the [Wiki](https://github.com/netbiosX/Checklists/wiki) page on Github.

# Contributions
If you noticed than a checklist is not complete please perform a pull request or contact me on Twitter [@netbiosX](www.twitter.com/netbiosX)

# Notice
This is a live repository which means that checklists will be updated as soon as articles are published.
